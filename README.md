Hey folks! ðŸŒŸ

For the next few months, I'll be playing around with this project, adding some fun bits here and there.
No expert in Flask, HTML, or CSS yetâ€”I'm just figuring it out as I go. Right now, my main jam is learning
machine learning. Cheers to that! ðŸŽ‰

I'm expecting a mix of chaos and laughter as I wrestle with code errors on my way to gaining mastery
with these tools

Happy coding to me!!!
